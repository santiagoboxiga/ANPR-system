# ANPR-system
This project implements a complete Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) pipeline using YOLO-based vehicle and license plate detection, SORT tracking, and FastALPR OCR. It processes videos to extract high-confidence license plate snapshots, then analyzes and exports results to an Excel file.
